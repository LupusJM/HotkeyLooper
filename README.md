# HotkeyLooper
This AutoHotkey script has a simple GUI with "Start" and "Stop" buttons. Clicking "Start" sends the "g" key every 5 secs, ideal for gaming progression or anti-AFK. It stops when "Stop" or "Esc" is pressed, giving manual control. Useful for automating tasks with customizable inputs and intervals.
